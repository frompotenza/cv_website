[DEPLOYED PROJECTS & RESEARCH]
============================================================

PROJECT  :: McGill Robotics - RoboSub AUV
ROLE     :: Senior Software Engineer
PERIOD   :: 2023 - 2024
------------------------------------------------------------
> Developed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems 
  for the international RoboSub competition.
> Created state machine-based autonomous decision-
  making processes for task execution based on controls 
  and vision mapping.
> Engineered a full quaternion-based PID control system 
  for high-precision 6-DOF maneuvering.
> Created simulation environments using Ignition Gazebo 
  and Unity, seamlessly integrated with ROS.
> Facilitated AUV deployment and testing in pool, 
  dry-land, and simulation environments.
> Developed comprehensive sensor integration and status 
  check mechanisms.
> Fully integrated hydrophone for accurate pinger-
  bearing calculations.
> TECH: ROS, Unity, Ignition Gazebo, YOLO, C++, Python.

PROJECT  :: Advanced Fish Population Monitoring System
ROLE     :: Research Project (Prof. Meger)
PERIOD   :: 2024
------------------------------------------------------------
> Designed a computer vision pipeline for detecting and 
  monitoring aquatic populations in 3D.
> Implemented geometrical optics calculations to track 
  precise movements over time from 2D camera feeds.
> Applied spatial analysis to map habitat preferences and 
  population distributions.
> TECH: Computer Vision, 3D Geometry, Spatial Analysis.

PROJECT  :: Prometheus Lab - Algorithm Stress Testing
ROLE     :: Research Project (Prof. Vybihal)
PERIOD   :: 2023
------------------------------------------------------------
> Investigated the effects of recommendation algorithms on 
  subgroup behavior.
> Developed an imitation algorithm that simulated human 
  interaction patterns based on real-world survey data.
> Engineered "stress tests" to identify edge cases and 
  extremes within recommendation systems.
> TECH: Python, Algorithmic Modeling, Data Analysis.
